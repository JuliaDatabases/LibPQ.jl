# [Type Conversions](@id typeconv)

The implementation of type conversions across the LibPQ.jl interface is sufficiently complicated
that it warrants its own section in the documentation.
Luckily, it should be easy to *use* for whichever case you need.

```@meta
DocTestSetup = quote
    using LibPQ
    using DataFrames
    using Tables

    DATABASE_USER = get(ENV, "LIBPQJL_DATABASE_USER", "postgres")
    conn = LibPQ.Connection("dbname=postgres user=$DATABASE_USER")
end
```

## From Julia to PostgreSQL

Currently all types are printed to strings and given to LibPQ as such, with no special treatment.
Expect this to change in a future release.
For now, you can convert the data to strings yourself before passing to [`execute`](@ref).
This should only be necessary for data types whose Julia string representation is not valid in
PostgreSQL, such as arrays.

```jldoctest
julia> A = collect(12:15);

julia> nt = columntable(execute(conn, "SELECT \$1 = ANY(\$2) AS result", Any[13, string("{", join(A, ","), "}")]));

julia> nt[:result][1]
true
```

## From PostgreSQL to Julia

The default type conversions applied when fetching PostgreSQL data should be sufficient in many
cases.

```julia
julia> df = DataFrame(execute(conn, "SELECT 1::int4, 'foo'::varchar, '{1.0, 2.1, 3.3}'::float8[], false, TIMESTAMP '2004-10-19 10:23:54'"))
1×5 DataFrames.DataFrame
│ Row │ int4 │ varchar │ float8          │ bool  │ timestamp           │
├─────┼──────┼─────────┼─────────────────┼───────┼─────────────────────┤
│ 1   │ 1    │ foo     │ [1.0, 2.1, 3.3] │ false │ 2004-10-19T10:23:54 │
```

The column types in Julia for the above DataFrame are `Int32`, `String`, `Vector{Float64}`, `Bool`,
and `DateTime`.

Any unknown or unsupported types are parsed as `String`s by default.

### `NULL`

The PostgreSQL `NULL` is handled with `missing`.
By default, data streamed using the Tables interface is `Union{T, Missing}`, and columns are
`Vector{Union{T, Missing}}`.
While `libpq` does not provide an interface for checking whether a result column contains `NULL`,
it's possible to assert that columns do not contain `NULL` using the `not_null` keyword argument to
[`execute`](@ref).
This will result in data retrieved as `T`/`Vector{T}` instead.
`not_null` accepts a list of column names or column positions, or a `Bool` asserting that all
columns do or do not have the possibility of `NULL`.

The type-related interfaces described below only deal with the `T` part of the `Union{T, Missing}`,
and there is currently no way to use an alternate `NULL` representation.

### Overrides

It's possible to override the default type conversion behaviour in several places.
Refer to the [Implementation](@ref) section for more detailed information.

#### Query-level

There are three arguments to [`execute`](@ref) for this:

* `column_types` argument to set the desired types for given columns.
  This is accepted as a dictionary mapping column names (as `Symbol`s or `String`s) and/or positions
  (as `Integer`s) to Julia types.
* `type_map` argument to set the mapping from PostgreSQL types to Julia types.
  This is accepted as a dictionary mapping PostgreSQL oids (as `Integer`s) or [canonical](@ref canon)
  type names (as `Symbol`s or `String`s) to Julia types.
* `conversions` argument to set the *function* used to convert from a given PostgreSQL type to a
  given Julia type.
  This is accepted as a dictionary mapping 2-tuples of PostgreSQL oids or type names (as above) and
  Julia types to callables (functions or type constructors).

#### Connection-level

[`LibPQ.Connection`](@ref) supports `type_map` and `conversions` arguments as well, which will apply
to all queries run with the created connection.
Query-level overrides will override connection-level overrides.

#### Global

To override behaviour for every query everywhere, add mappings to the global constants
[`LibPQ.LIBPQ_TYPE_MAP`](@ref) and [`LibPQ.LIBPQ_CONVERSIONS`](@ref).
Connection-level overrides will override these global overrides.

### Implementation

#### Flow

When a [`LibPQ.Result`](@ref) is created (as the result of running a query), the Julia types and
conversion functions for each column are precalculated and stored within the `Result`.
The types are chosen using these sources, in decreasing priority:

* `column_types` overrides at `Result` level
* `type_map` overrides at `Result` level
* `type_map` overrides at `Connection` level
* [`LibPQ.LIBPQ_TYPE_MAP`](@ref)
* [`LibPQ._DEFAULT_TYPE_MAP`](@ref)
* fallback to `String`

Using those types, the function for converting from PostgreSQL data to Julia data is selected,
using these sources, in decreasing priority:

* `conversions` overrides at `Result` level
* `conversions` overrides at `Connection` level
* [`LibPQ.LIBPQ_CONVERSIONS`](@ref)
* [`LibPQ._DEFAULT_CONVERSIONS`](@ref),
* fallback to `parse`

When fetching a particular value from a `Result`, that function is used to turn data wrapped by a
`PQValue` to a Julia type.
This operation always copies or parses data and never provides a view into the original `Result`.

#### [Canonical PostgreSQL Type Names](@id canon)

While PostgreSQL allows many aliases for its types (e.g., `double precision` for `float8` and
`character varying` for `varchar`), there is one "canonical" name for the type stored in the
`pg_type` table from PostgreSQL's catalog.
You can find a list of these for all of PostgreSQL's default types in the keys of
[`LibPQ.PQ_SYSTEM_TYPES`](@ref).
